  | Hi #{email},
  br
  | This is your reminder to follow-up to "#{application.name}". Here's some information from your application:

  br
  b= "Posting URL: "
  a(href=application.posting_url)= application.posting_url
  br
  b= "Application link: "
  - var applicationUrl = getExternalUrl(application.url);
  a(href=applicationUrl)= applicationUrl
  br

  //- DEV: We initially designed to list "Past interviews" but notes is more relevant
  b Application notes:
  br
  if application.notes
    != sanitizeHtml(application.notes)
  else
    i No notes recorded
  br
  br
  = "If you would like to create another application reminder, then "
  a(href=applicationUrl) click here to set up a new reminder
