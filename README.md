## Getting started
TODO: Add me

## Documentation
### Development
Currently, we don't have any server components. To host the files locally in development, we are using `serve`.

To run a development server locally, run:

```bash
npm start
```

The files will be available at <http://localhost:9000/server/views/>

### Building files
We offer compilation of CSS/JS via 2 means:

**Single run:** Compile our files only once

```bash
npm run build
```

**Continuous:** Compile our files and re-compile when they change

```bash
npm run develop
```

### Automated refresh
We integrate with LiveReload by starting a LiveReload server when `npm run develop` is running.

As a result, if you enable/install a LiveReload browser extension, then it will automatically reload the page when files change.
